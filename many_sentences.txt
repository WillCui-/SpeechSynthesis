New measures to prevent unions taking action where only a minority of members have engaged with the ballot process (and the number voting for action is therefore an even smaller minority), are one of the central planks of the new Trade Union Act, and may bring about the biggest changes in practice.

Whereas in the past, a “Yes” vote by a majority of those union members returning ballots was sufficient to authorise industrial action, at least 50% of all those entitled to vote must now do so for any resulting action to be authorised.

So, if 500 union members are affected by a dispute, at least 250 of those will now need to vote in order for the ballot to be valid.
